			<p> Hey, I'm Daiwik, and I am a first year Computer Science student at Georgia Tech from Franklin, Massachusetts. I am passionate about improving the human condition using my computer science skills, especially through assistive technology projects. My greatest experience has been creating computer mice for people with Parkinson's disease. I loved working with real clients and making something that had a direct positive impact on their lives. I hope to continue making an impact in the community through Bits of Good! </p>
